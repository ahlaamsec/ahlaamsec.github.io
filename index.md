# 👋 Hey, I'm Ahlaam Abdallah

🛡️ Ethical Hacker in Training | ⚡ Future Penetration Tester | 🧠 Professional System Breaker (Legally)

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where machines get interrogated, ports confess secrets, and vulnerable boxes regret their life choices.

This site documents my journey from curious student to lethal penetration tester, one lab, one exploit, one root shell at a time.

# 🔹 About Me

🎓 Computer Science Graduate on National Service
🧪 Currently deep in daily hacking labs and real-world vulnerable machines
🎯 Focused on becoming a professional penetration tester
🌌 Exploring systems not to destroy them, but to understand them completely

I believe every system tells a story. My job is to listen carefully… and escalate privileges.

---

# ⚡ What I'm Doing Right Now

• Breaking vulnerable machines like Kioptrix and TCM labs
• Solving Bandit and other privilege escalation challenges
• Building deep intuition for Linux systems and network behavior
• Documenting everything so others can learn faster

This is not theory. This is hands-on, keyboard-to-kernel learning.

# 🛠️ Weapons of Choice

## 🔐 Recon & Exploitation

* Nmap
* Netcat
* Metasploit
* Burp Suite

## 🐧 Systems & OS

* Kali Linux
* Linux Privilege Escalation
* Bash & Linux Commands

## 🧠 Logic & Scripting

* Python
* SQL
* Manual enumeration techniques

Tools don't hack systems. Understanding does.

# 🚀 Current Mission

Documenting real machine compromises including:

* Kioptrix series
* TCM Security labs
* Bandit privilege escalation labs
* More vulnerable machines coming soon

Each walkthrough is written so beginners can follow and grow.

No gatekeeping. Just signal.

# 🧠 Learning Philosophy

I don't memorize exploits.

I understand systems.

Because tools change.
But knowledge compounds.

# 🧭 Mission Statement

This site exists to document the journey.

From beginner → professional
From scanning ports → owning systems
From curiosity → mastery

If you're walking the same path, you're not alone.

Welcome to the lab.
